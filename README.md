Checkpoint 3: Game Test Summary
Questions for game testers:

How do you feel about the controlling of the spaceship(movement, shooting, and shield)?
Did the cargo slowing mechanic feel clear and noticeable?
Did the obstacles and components easy to distinguish and how do you feel about their speed?
How do you feel about the audio, effects and video of the game?
Did the spawning pace of obstacles and components feel fair, too slow, or too fast?
Did you experience any bugs or confusing UI while playing the game?
Is there anything you would improve or add to the game?
Feedback from testers:
Tom Xu(My brother):
Good.
Yes.
Yes, and the speed of the obstacle is slow making the game very easy.
The effects and audio are good, but the video played after entering the portal is too long.
A little bit too easy.
No, but the UI can be polished.
Polish the UI, and the video.

Rick Feng(My highschool friend):
Good.
Yes.
Yes, and the speed of obstacles and components are good as well.
Good.
Too slow.
No.
The game is not challenging enough.

Henry Shangguan:
Good.
Noticeable when the cargo is full.
Easy to distinguish and they both are slow in speed.
The effects look good, but need UI control on the volume of audio, and the video after entering the portal is very long and not necessary.
Fair.
No, but the UI is a little bit ugly.
Make the UI look better.

Common patterns I noticed:
The control of the spaceship is good enough.
The cargo slowing mechanic is noticeable.
The speed of obstacles might need to be faster since 2 testers mentioned the speed of the obstacle is slow, but the speed of the obstacle will actually increase every time after the player enters the portal and back to space(No matter if they upgrade their spaceship or not).
Effects and audio are good, but video needs to be shorter or replaced.
Spawning pace of obstacles and components are slow(mentioned by 2 testers), but I have explained that above. The spawning pace and moving pace will increase gradually.
Testers didn’t experience any bugs, but all of them have mentioned that the UI need to be polished
Need improvement on UI and add audio control.

Common patterns noticed by AI(ChatGPT)

1. Core Controls Feel Good
All testers said the movement, shooting, and shield controls feel good.
 → This means your base gameplay mechanics are solid and intuitive.
2. Cargo-Slowing Mechanic Is Clear
Everyone understood or noticed the mechanic.
 → No confusion here; the feature communicates well to players.
3. Obstacles Are Too Slow → Game Is Too Easy
All testers said obstacles/components are easy to distinguish, but their speed is slow.
Tom → game is very easy
Rick → spawning is too slow
Henry → both slow
→ Overall conclusion: The game lacks challenge due to slow obstacle speed or pacing.
4. Video After Portal Is Too Long
Two testers (Tom, Henry) explicitly said the portal video is too long or unnecessary.
 → This is a clear consistent issue.
5. Audio/Effects Look Good, But UI Needs Improvement
All testers praised effects/audio, BUT:
Tom → UI can be polished
Henry → UI is ugly + needs volume control
Rick → no UI issues, but doesn’t contradict others
Common theme:
 The UI is visually weak or incomplete, and players want more control (especially volume settings).
6. Difficulty/Spawning Pace Needs Adjustment
Two testers found it too easy, one found pace “fair” but still said obstacles are slow.
 → Combined with slow obstacles, the pattern is:
Players want more difficulty — faster obstacles or faster spawn rate.
7. No Major Bugs Reported
All testers said no bugs or confusing UI (aside from general UI quality).
 → Technical stability is good.
Comparison between my findings and AI’s findings
Actually, the findings of mine and AI’s are mostly the same, we both notice that the players think the game is a little bit easy, but as my explanation above says. The difficulty and challenge of the game will increase gradually, so the start of the game is easy, and I might not change that. And also both of us notice that the testers want me to improve the UI of the game and they think the video is long or not necessary, so I will consider replacing the original video with a black screen loading video. And I will also add a control of audio in the UI as well.

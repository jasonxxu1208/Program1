# CSS385 Program2

Done based on Program1, but added more interaction model
Interaction Model:
1. The player will control the rocket by pressing LMB and move the mouse
2. The player can fire a bullet by pressing "Space". The bullet can destroy the obstacle, but has 2.5 seconds cooldown
3. Player can make the rocket sprint by pressing "LeftShift", but also has cooldown
4. Player can activate a shield around the rocket and defence the collision with obstacle by once.

Brief write-up on how this interaction model can be used in different parts of the game and why?
This interaction model uses mouse and keyboard input to control movement, shooting, and object creation. It can be applied in gameplay for moving and attacking, in building modes for placing or removing objects, and in menus for selecting options. Using the same control method across different parts of the game keeps interaction simple, consistent, and engaging for players.
